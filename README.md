- Size of spots and transports are configurable, check variable SPOT_SIZE in src/constants/spots.constants.ts and variable TRANSPORT_SIZE in src/transports/transports.constants.ts;

- Input string for type of spot and transport are also configurable, check enum SpotType in src/constants/spots.constants.ts and enum TransportType in src/transports/transports.constants.ts;

- You can find all neccesery API requests with their overview in rest-api/spots.http and rest-api/transports.http;
